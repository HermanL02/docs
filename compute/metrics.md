**Latency:** 
Latency levels are on par with leading cloud VM instances.

    For reference, this is typically 20-30ms (up to 50ms) latency. Node location may influence latency.

**Cost:** 
During our testnet phase, costs are provisional as **$KOII** is not monetized.

    Expected to provide substantial savings, 75% savings compared to AWS. Hourly cost differences can accumulate over time.

**Speed:** 
With appropriate incentives, Koii can exceed AWS in efficiency, leveraging hundreds or even thousands of nodes to tackle a single task.

    Tasks can be simultaneously processed by hundreds to thousands of compute nodes.
    Peak performance numbers are still under evaluation.

**Uptime:** Benefit from the resilience of a decentralized network â€” it's almost always operational.

    Intermittent downtimes occur approximately once every 1-2 years, but these are typically scheduled and communicated in advance.
