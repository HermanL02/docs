# Example Task: Linktree

:::info

This Koii task is the second in our series of explaining Koii tasks. If you haven't completed our Google Doodle task, you can do so [here](/develop/microservices-and-tasks/google-doodle-task/).

A **LinkTree** is a tool that enables you to create a customized page that contains all the important links you want to share with your audience. Once you've created your Linktree and added all of your links, all you need to do is copy your Linktree URL and share it across to reach your audience.

An example of users Koii linktree profile is shown below:

Soma Li, our amazing developer, built this project, and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/koii-network/linktree-app).

The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize you with more advanced topics that will help you write your own Koii tasks.
