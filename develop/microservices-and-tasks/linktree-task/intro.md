# Example Task: Linktree

A **LinkTree** is a tool that enables you to create a customized page that contains all the important links you want to share with your audience. Once you've created your Linktree and added all of your links, all you need to do is copy your Linktree URL and share it across to reach your audience.

We will build and deploy the backend of a linktree project on the Koii network in this tutorial. The project will be run on over 40,000 Koii nodes, providing a tamper-proof and highly secure network. When a client's data is updated, Koii nodes verify a wallet signature to authorize the update.


Below is an example a user's linktree of this project:

Soma Li, our amazing developer, built this project, and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/somali0128/task-template-linktree).
