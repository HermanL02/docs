# Example Task: Linktree

This task is the second task in our series of explaining Koii tasks. The [Google Doodle task](/develop/microservices-and-tasks/google-doodle-task/) takes you through the process of turning a simple javascript program into a Koii task using the K2 Task Template. This tutorial will build on that and teach you how to use databases across many Koii nodes.

A LinkTree is a customized page that contains all the important links you want to share. The images below show a few examples of the Koii linktree. You can see the deployed version of the app <a href="https://linktree.koii.network" target="_blank">here</a>.

You can access the full project <a href="https://github.com/koii-network/linktree-app" target="_blank">here</a>

Once you have cloned the project, navigate to the task-template-linktree folder

```bash
cd task-template-linktree
```

Navigate to the test folder

```bash
cd test
```

You will find some pre-written tests here. You can go through the tests for all the files explained in this tutorial. Once you have a better understanding of the files discussed in this tutorial, feel free to edit these tests to familiarize yourself better with their implementation. You will need a strong understanding of these concepts for writing your Koii tasks.


The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize you with more advanced topics that will help you write your own Koii tasks.
