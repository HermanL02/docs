The distribution stage is the next step, where a node is chosen to create and submit a distribution list on-chain after the nodes have completed their off-chain duties and verified one another's submissions.

## `generateDistributionList()`
Based on the submitted proofs, the `generateDistributionList()` method generates the [distribution list](/develop/microservices-and-tasks/task-development-guide/k2-task-template/distribution-functions) for the distribution of rewards. It takes into account valid submissions, penalizes nodes that provided incorrect proofs, and computes rewards for nodes that provided correct submissions. 

The distribution list is critical for ensuring that nodes are appropriately rewarded for their efforts.


## `submitDistributionList()`

This method submits the distribution list generated by `generateDistributionList()` to K2.

For the example on the template:

- The `generateDistributionList()` is called to retrieve the distribution list
- The distribution list is submitted on-chain

:::note

We'd retain the current logic for the `submitDistributionList()` and `generateDistributionList()` methods, so no need to edit them.
