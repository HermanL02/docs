Within the tests folder, you can find multiple tests. One of the more important tests is the test-one-round.js. This test will locally simulate running the extractor for one round and will output the results in the console. This test is useful to see if the extractor is working as expected.

You can run a test with:

yarn
node test/test-one-round.js
