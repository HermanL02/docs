# What are Tasks?

<Description
  text="Building truly decentralized systems requires a complicated mix of incentive engineering and cryptographic- Gradual Consensus in Koii Tasks standardize this structure to provide a single community cloud toolkit for all purposes."
/>

Whether you're building a database, newsfeed, federated learning network, or a storage and caching service, you'll need the same three components.

      The Decentralized Cookbook:

      1. Incentives
      2. Fraud Prevention
      3. Synchronization

Koii tasks are off-chain computations that are verified and submitted on-chain, then audited by other nodes. This unique structure of accountability allows task nodes to perform a range of easily customizable services, providing a flexible and efficient foundation for a wide range of applications.

<p>Koii tasks (currently in beta) provide a microservices economy to app developers, where nodes trustlessly complete off-chain executables, and return the results on-chain. Witness nodes track this process, verifying the work, and auditing any malicious parties.</p>
