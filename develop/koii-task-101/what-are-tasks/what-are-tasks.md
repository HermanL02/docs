Koii tasks are off-chain computations that are verified and submitted on-chain, then audited by other nodes. This unique structure of accountability allows task nodes to perform a range of easily customizable services and provides the foundation for a highly transparent and trustless internet without the scaling limitations of traditional blockchains.

<p>Koii tasks (currently in beta) provide a microservices economy to app developers, where nodes trustlessly complete off-chain executables, and return the results on-chain. Witness nodes track this process, verifying the work, and auditing any malicious parties.</p>
