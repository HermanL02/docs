**Google Doodle** task is a simple Koii task for retrieving and validating a scraped doodle. It is a simple Koii task and an excellent way to get started writing Koii tasks.

Let's first understand the logic behind the task before moving on to the coding aspect.

# Google Doodle Task Logic

The latest google doodle is scraped from [Google/doodles](https://www.google.com/doodles) and submitted to K2.

To validate a node's submission, the most recent Google doodle is retrieved and compared to what was submitted to K2. If it does, the node's submission is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
