# Getting Started

First step is to clone the [Task-template](https://github.com/koii-network/task-template).

:::info

Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), npm and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed before going forward.

:::

# Steps

1. Open the terminal inside a directory of your choice.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koii-network/task-template.git google-doodle
```

3. Change the directory and install all the dependencies, using this command:

```bash
cd google-doodle && yarn add puppeteer cheerio
```

Next up, we start writing the logic of the google-doodle task.
