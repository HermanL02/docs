Koii is a distributed cloud platform that offers cost reduction and enhanced reliability. It achieves this by utilizing a network of computers known as "nodes."

## Higher reliability

The key to the system's reliability lies in the participation of multiple nodes. If a node leaves the system, another node promptly takes its place, ensuring continuous functionality.

## Reduced costs 

Unlike traditional cloud systems, Koii operates on a "compute" payment model rather than a "device" payment model. This approach lowers the overall operational costs. 

## Nodes and Tasks

Within the Koii ecosystem, task nodes actively engage in the system as they receive incentives for running applications, referred to as Koii Tasks.

In the following section, you will learn how to create a simple Koii Task that runs on this distributed network.
