Koii is a distributed cloud platform that offers cost reduction and enhanced reliability. This is achieved by utilizing a network of computers known as "nodes."

## Reduced costs 

Unlike traditional cloud systems, Koii operates on a **compute** payment model rather than a **device** payment model. This means that you only pay for the work output needed. This approach lowers the overall operational costs.

## Higher reliability

The key to the system's reliability lies in the participation of multiple nodes. If a node leaves the system, another node promptly takes its place, ensuring continuous functionality.


## Nodes and Tasks

**Nodes** are devices (usually personal computers) that make up this distributed cloud. You can build applications called **Tasks** that will run on these nodes.
