# Pre-Requisite
If you'd like to learn more about what KPL is, please visit [KPL](/docs/koii/the-koii-token/add-koii-to-exchange/kpl-tokens) webpage.

If you're looking to get your first KPL Token, feel free to visit our [KPL Token Creator](https://kpl.koii.network).

To check all your KPL tokens balance, you can visit the Explorer at `https://explorer.koii.live/address/<Your Public Key Here>/tokens`

## Use it as Bounty

If you plan to use KPL as your bounty, ensure that your wallet holds a sufficient balance of the corresponding tokens, such as FIRE. Make sure to correctly set up your config-task.yaml, referencing the guide at /develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli/create-task. You can also follow the guided steps in our create-task-cli to set up a KPL task.

## Why KPL? 
With KPL Token, you only need to pay the space fee instead of the bounty fee as a task. You can create and mint your own KPL tokens for your task testing as a individual task developer. Besides, people can launch their projects with their own KPL tokens to make your tokens have value.
