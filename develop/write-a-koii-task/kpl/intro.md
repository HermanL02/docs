## Pre-Requisite

If you'd like to learn more about what KPL is, please visit KPL.

If you're looking to get your first KPL Token, feel free to visit our KPL Token Creator.

To check your KPL balance, you can visit the Explorer at `https://explorer.koii.live/address/<Your Public Key Here>/tokens`

## Use it as Bounty

If you plan to use KPL as your bounty, ensure that your wallet holds a sufficient balance of the corresponding tokens, such as FIRE. Make sure to correctly set up your config-task.yaml, referencing the guide at /develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli/create-task. You can also follow the guided steps in our create-task-cli to set up a KPL task.

### Why KPL?

With KPL Token, you only need to pay the space fee instead of the bounty fee as a task. You can create and mint your own KPL tokens for your task testing with only paying the space rent fee.
