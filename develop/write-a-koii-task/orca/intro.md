The Orca node and client are a pair of tools that allow developers to create Koii tasks using Docker containers.

## Advantages of Orca

1. **Containerization:** Orca allows developers to run software within Docker containers. This allows them to write a Koii task in whatever language they prefer, with minimal configuration. It also allows the use of additional services such as a database server or message queue.

2. **Deployment and Management:** Using the Orca task template, a developer can deploy a containerized Koii task simply by creating a few REST endpoints within their container. This allows existing applications to be easily integrated with Koii.

3. **Integration and Scalability:** By deploying on Koii, developers get access to a network of over 90,000 nodes, enabling easy scaling without the usual bottlenecks of physical infrastructure, and with a cost far lower than traditional cloud providers. This is particularly valuable in environments that require high availability and performance.

4. **Security and Isolation:** Each containerized application runs in isolation, which enhances security by minimizing the risk of interference from other processes. This isolation also aids in conflict resolution and resource management, making it easier to maintain and troubleshoot applications.

In summary, Orca abstracts much of the complexity of working with containerized application in a decentralized system. This allows developers to focus more on innovation and less on infrastructure management.
