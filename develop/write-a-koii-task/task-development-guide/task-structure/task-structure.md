# Task Structure

The Koii [task template](https://github.com/koii-network/task-template) contains three separate JavaScript files that contain all of the functions for a Koii task to function properly.


```javascript
ðŸ“¦K2-TASK-TEMPLATE
 â”£ ðŸ“‚_koiiNode
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œkoiiNode.js // Contain all the components that task connect to K2.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚task
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.js // Main file that contains the task function.
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œsubmission.js // Contains the task function and submitTask function.
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œaudit.js // Contains the auditTask function.
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œdistribution.js // Contains the submitDistributionList and auditDistribution function.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚tests
 â”£ ðŸ“œconfig-task.yml
 â”£ ðŸ“œcoreLogic.js
 â”— ðŸ“œindex.js

 ```

The task function, audit function, and distribution function were mentioned in the previous section; you can find `task/submission.js`, `task/audit.js`, and `task/distribution.js` in the task template that contains the functions for each of these steps.
