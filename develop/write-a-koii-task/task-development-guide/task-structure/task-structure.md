# Task Structure

The Koii [task template](https://github.com/koii-network/task-template) contains three separate JavaScript files that contain all of the functions for a Koii task to function properly.

The task function, audit function, and distribution function were mentioned in the previous section; you can find `task/submission.js`, `task/audit.js`, and `task/distribution.js` in the task template that contains the functions for each of these steps.
