# Whitelist Task

:::caution

Contact the development team on the [Koii Discord](https://discord.gg/koiin) and share your:&#x20;

- Executable file
- State Info Pubkey

Then ask them to whitelist your task

**Note**: Other nodes can still run your task if it's not whitelisted, but will not be able to use the Koii Node to find it.&#x20;

To run a task without whitelisting first, use the flag `RUN_NON_WHITELISTED_TASKS=true` while [running the CLI node](/run-a-node/introduction/task-nodes).
