# Storage via IPFS

IPFS can be easily implemented as decentralized storage for a task. Using libraries such as [Spheron](https://docs.spheron.network/storage/), data can easily be stored, retrieved, and maintained on IPFS. The stored data will be referenced using [IPFS content identifiers](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) that are unique to the data, making your data completely portable and accessible from anywhere broadcasting data to the IPFS network, whether on a local or peer device or uploaded to Spheron.


# Spheron Tutorial
See our tutorial on **[Spheron Infrascructure](https://docs.spheron.network/storage/)** for how to get started!
