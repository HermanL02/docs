# Connecting Finnie

### Web3 Browser Detection&#x20;

When Finnie wallet is initialized it will emit a custom browser event called `finnieWalletLoaded()`.  
You can listen for that event and set a flag in your app which would indicate that Finnie is ready to use. The example code could look like this:

```jsx
let isFinnieInjected = false;
window.addEventListener("finnieWalletLoaded", () => {
  isFinnieInjected = true;
});
```

At this point, Finnie wallet will inject the `ethereum` provider object into the global `window` object. You can verify this by running the code:

```jsx
if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined" && window.ethereum.isFinnie) {
  console.log("Finnie is installed");
}
```
