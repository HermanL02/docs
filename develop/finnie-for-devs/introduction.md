Building cross-chain applications might be optimal for developers, but what about the communities that use these products?

The Finnie wallet provides some key features right out of the box, and we're working on adding more:

1. **Cross-Chain Wallets**: Ethereum and Arweave are supported now. Filecoin, NEAR, Polygon, and more are coming soon!

2. **Attention Tracking**: Koii's native token (KOII) can only be mined by tracking attention on your content. Finnie supports these features natively, providing hooks to sign Proofs of Real Traffic, and streamlining uploads to Koii nodes.
3. **Decentralized IDs**: Finnie users can also manage their personal DID profiles from within the wallet and can provide easy-to-access hooks for developers wishing to build personalized user experiences.
