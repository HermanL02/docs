# Wallets

There are three solutions for holding KOII token, each targetted to a different use case:

- [Finnie Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/finnie/cjmkndjhnagcfbpiemnkdpomccnjblmj) - this Chrome Extension wallet provides an easy to use tool for beginners, along with more advanced features for developers and crypto-aficionados
- [Desktop Node](https://share.hsforms.com/1kLtk8rfURZ-HY2xnKRTfCgc20dg) - used to manage staking wallets for participating in Tasks
- Native Wallet File - best used for developers and with Koii-based apps

## Finnie Wallet

Finnie is designed to act as a browsing companion for the decentralized web:

- Drag and Drop NFT Minting
- Integrated DIDs
- Ethereum and EVM Wallet Functions
- Solana Wallet Functions
- Arweave Wallet Functions
- Filecoin Wallet Functions (Coming Soon)

## Desktop Node&#x20;

In order to rent your personal devices to the network and participate in the Compute Marketplace, you'll often need to hold KOII and other tokens in a staking wallet, which can be confiscated when if your node is caught trying to submit bad data.&#x20;

**Note:** Your collateral will never be confiscated for honest work [(see the Audits section for more information)](/develop/microservices-and-tasks/what-are-tasks/what-are-audits)

The desktop node hasn't been released to the public yet, but you can join the beta by clicking the form below.

## Native Wallet File

Native Filesystem wallets are used by developers building applications, or during testing. For information about using filesystem wallets as a developer, check the CLI Docs.
