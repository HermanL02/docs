There are three solutions for holding KOII token, each targetted to a different use case:

- [Finnie Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/finnie/cjmkndjhnagcfbpiemnkdpomccnjblmj) — This chrome extension wallet provides an easy to use tool for beginners, along with more advanced features for developers and crypto-aficionados
- [Desktop Node](https://share.hsforms.com/1kLtk8rfURZ-HY2xnKRTfCgc20dg) — Used to manage staking wallets for participating in tasks
- Native Wallet File — Best used for developers and with Koii-based apps

## Finnie Wallet

Finnie is designed to act as a browsing companion for the decentralized web:

- Drag and drop NFT minting
- Integrated DIDs
- Ethereum and EVM wallet functions
- Solana wallet functions
- Arweave wallet functions
- Filecoin wallet functions **(coming soon)**

## Desktop Node&#x20;

In order to rent your personal devices to the network and participate in the **compute marketplace**, you'll often need to hold KOII and other tokens in a staking wallet, which can be confiscated when if your node is caught trying to submit bad data.&#x20;

**Note:** Your collateral will never be confiscated for honest work [(see the audits section for more information)](/develop/designing-tasks/securing-task)

The desktop node hasn't been released to the public yet, but you can join the beta by clicking the form below.

## Native Wallet File

Native file-system wallets are used by developers building applications, or during testing. For information about using file-system wallets as a developer, check the CLI docs.
