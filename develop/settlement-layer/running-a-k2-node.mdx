# Running a K2 Node

<Description
  text="This section describes how to run a Koii Node."
/>

A K2 node is any computer running the software needed to submit proofs, request rewards for computing work, collect Proofs of Real Traffic, and submit batches of them into decentralized storage. These nodes work together to verify the output of untrusted, user-submitted programs.&#x20;

Before proceeding to the next steps, make sure you have first [installed the Koii command-line tools](https://docs.koii.network/microservices-and-tasks/task-development-guide/task-development-flow/koii-cli).
