# The Task Contract

The Task Contract maintains the [Koii Compute Marketplace](/concepts/earning-koii/compute-sharing-marketplace), and can be used to deploy, audit, and incentivize new Tasks for the network. The Task Contract is not yet Open Sourced, but check back soon for the full K2 Source Code.

### Check out the Task Docs to use our network of honest compute devices!
