# The Attention Game

## Playing the Game

To start mining Koii, there are two options:

### **1. Use the Finnie Wallet to Upload Content**

The Finnie Wallet is Koii's native Browser Extension, and supports drag and drop NFT minting, which can be used to turn any file on your computer into a revenue-generating asset that mines KOII tokens every time it's viewed.

Just drag, drop, and share to start tracking views and earning KOII.

### **2. Register Web Content Programmatically**

If you have existing content online, such as a blog, website, or app, you can use the developer kit to track attention on your content and mine KOII for every view.
