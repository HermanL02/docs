:::info

At this time we only support Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. We offer macOS and Windows binaries however we do not have official guides on how to set up your validator environment on those operating systems.

:::

## Staking

There is no minimum amount of KOII required to stake and participate in the voting process.

To participate in the voting process you must configure your system,start a validator and configure your voting and stake accounts. This guide will show you how to do this.
