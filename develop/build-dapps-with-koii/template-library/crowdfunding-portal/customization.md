# Customization

### Customize the config file

You can customize your crowdfunding portal to receive funding to your wallet by following these steps.

Head to the [**funding-config.tsx**](https://github.com/koii-network/crowdfunding/blob/master/src/config/funding-config.tsx) file in your app, you'll notice a `config` object that you can change to match your portal config. e.g:

```jsx
const config = {
  title: "Plagiarism Registry DAO", // Project title
  description:
    "Fighting plagiarism with a searchable, creator-owned world wide registry. Get rewarded for your work.", // Project description
  companyName: "Koii Network Creator Studio",
  fundGoal: 1000, // Your funding goal in "eth"
  images: [
    // Images to be placed in the top slider
    { src: "https://picsum.photos/700" },
    { src: "https://picsum.photos/701" },
    { src: "https://picsum.photos/702" },
    { src: "https://picsum.photos/703" },
    { src: "https://picsum.photos/704" },
    { src: "https://picsum.photos/705" },
  ],
  socials: {
    // Your social network links
    website: "https://koii.network",
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/KoiiNetwork",
    discord: "https://discord.com/invite/koii",
    facebook: null,
    github: "https://github.com/koii-network",
  },
  paymentType: "eth", // Payment type (Currency) for now, we only support "eth" (ethereum)
  fundAddress: "0x0123456789", // Your ethereum funding address that people will deposit to.
  // A brief description about the project as html.
  about: (
    <div>
      <p>About us</p>
    </div>
  ),

  faqs: [
    // FAQs content
    { question: "Question 1", answer: "Answer 1" },
    { question: "Question 2", answer: "Answer 2" },
    { question: "Question 3", answer: "Answer 3" },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

You don't need to do anything after customizing your funding config for the Portal to workâ€”it should work nicely by itself. But just in case you need to use any value from your funding config use the `useFunding` hook

### useFunding

```jsx
import { useFunding } from "components/funding";

const {
  state: { config, fundModal },
  dispatch,
} = useFunding();
```

To get any funding config value inside any component:

```jsx
const your-config-address = config.fundAddress;
```

Or to dispatch any [**funding action**](https://github.com/koii-network/koii.X/blob/main/src/components/funding/FundingContext/index.tsx#L44)\*\*\*\*

```jsx
dispatch({ type: "CLOSE_FUND_MODAL});
// Hint: this dispatch action will close the funding modal
```

All available [**actions**](https://github.com/koii-network/koii.X/blob/main/src/components/funding/FundingContext/index.tsx#L50).
