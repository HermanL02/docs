Crowdfunding is an increasingly popular way for content creators and developers to gauge interest in and raise capital for their projects. While Kickstarter and its many copycats provide centralized crowdfunding tools, we believe in a crypto-first approach.

Using Koii-X's simple dApp template to deploy a crowdfunding portal allows you to have total control over your crowdfunding in as little as 10 minutes. Check out the demo and get started with instructions on how to customize it below ðŸ‘‡
