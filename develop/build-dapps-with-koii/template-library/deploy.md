## Deploy to Arweave

Follow these simple steps to deploy to your Leaderboard or Crowdfunding portal to Arweave:

:::info
**First of all** :bell:&#x20;

Get your wallet.json file ready and put it in your dApp root folder

For the Leaderboard:

ðŸ“¦KoiiX  
â”— ðŸ“œwallet.json

For Crowdfunding:

ðŸ“¦Fundraiser-Portal  
â”— ðŸ“œwallet.json
:::

1. Install [arkb](https://github.com/textury/arkb) globally on your machine. arkb runs using NodeJS and NPM. You must have both installed on your machine for it to work.

   `npm install -g arkb`

   Or head to [arkb](https://github.com/textury/arkb#how-to-use) installation guide.

2. Finally, Run:

   `yarn deploy`

`yarn deploy` is a shortcut of  
`yarn build && arkb deploy build -w wallet.json --timeout=50000 --debug`

Check if everything looks good, then enter "Y" to confirm upload.  
Give it a second for your dApp to deploy to Arweave and you will receive your transaction ID.

:::caution

- You will need around 0.01 AR to deploy.
- Please make sure your node version is higher than v16.13.1
- Check your node version: `node -v`

### Track attention of your deployment

To track the attention of your deployed DApp:

1. Get the transaction `id`  
   You should get this `id` after the deployment is done. It follows this format `https://arweave.net/<txid>`&#x20;
2. Import the port. Or create your own like [this](https://github.com/koii-network/koii.X/blob/main/src/services/port/index.js).  
   `import port from "services/port";`
3. Submit your transaction `id` to the port to track it.  
   `port.propagatePoRT(id)`

### After Deployment

- Arweave info  
  To check your dApp. Please visit: [**https://arweave.net/** `<txid>`](https://arweave.net/bfBeXkcccukv7DXbllIv1wBU69jZCN9YX3tL3V-TAas)
