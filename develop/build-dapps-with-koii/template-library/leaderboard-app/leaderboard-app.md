Many of the internet's most popular websites are designed with the same principles in mind as leaderboard apps. The difference is that on Web 2.0, your views are tracked and your data is analyzed, repackaged, and sold so that the company can make a profit from the content that you create.&#x20;

Using Koii-X's simple dApp template, you can deploy your own leaderboard app to web 3.0 and join the attention economy, earning tokens for your content. Attention tracking using the Proofs of Real Traffic system (PoRT) is already baked into the template so that your Atomic NFTs will immediately start earning rewards.&#x20;

**Example Web 2.0 Websites**

These websites all earn from content that YOU create. Barely rewarding you for your contributions (if at all).&#x20;

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Reddit
- Pinterest
- YouTube
