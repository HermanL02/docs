<Description
  text="Koii combines decentralized rails and incentives with traditional tools"
/>

Here is a list of some of the tools that can be used together when implementing Koii-X. With a combination of simple dApp templates and a variety of content storage and wallet integration options, building on web3 has never been easier.&#x20;

### Task Nodes

The basic element of the Koii Network is the ability to deploy scalable microservices, called **Tasks**, which can run on as many nodes as necessary to support your project.&#x20;

### K2 Settlement Layer

The K2 Layer utilizes a fork of a Solana Node to provide high-speed transactions and tracks voting between Task Nodes. Unlike Solana, K2 stores its blockchain history on decentralized file storage networks instead of locally, providing a somewhat larger capacity. K2 also has higher Rent costs for data uploads, favoring storage alternatives and generally an option for small payloads or ideally Boolean votes to reduce loads.&#x20;

### Templates from Koii

Koii currently has two templates available, which both support KOII token mining via attention tracking right out of the box.

- [**Crowdfunding Portal**](../template-library/crowdfunding-portal/)
- [**Content Leaderboard App**](../template-library/leaderboard-app/)

### Decentralized Storage

By default, packages are optimized to use storage networks rather than traditional hosting.

- Store files on peer-to-peer networks that span the globe
- Protect art and free speech with censorship-resistant ledgers
- Pay anonymously with cryptocurrency
- Supported: [Arweave](../../koii-software-toolkit-sdk/basic-utility-functions/arweave-and-general-utility/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) (Coming Soon)

### Wallet Integrations

The Koii-X Templates have been designed to support a number of wallets out of the box.

- [**Finnie Wallet**](https://koii.network/getFinnie) (ECDSA, RSA \~ Ethereum, Arweave )
- [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/) (Ethereum, Polygon)
- [**ArConnect**](https://www.arconnect.io/) (Arweave)
