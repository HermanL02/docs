### Build apps that make \~waves\~ (and earn tokens!) :fish:&#x20;

Building decentralized applications is hard, but we've built tools to make it easier.

Some topics included in this section:

- Easy deployment
- Simple dApp templates
- [**UI templates** ](/develop/build-dapps-with-koii/template-library/ui-template-layout/)
- [**Wallet integration**](/develop/build-dapps-with-koii/integrating-wallets/)
- Quick integration of attention tracking
- Use of [**atomic NFTs**](/develop/build-dapps-with-koii/using-nfts-as-content/create-nfts) to ensure permanent ownership and storage of media.&#x20;

This toolkit will help you take advantage of all that Koii has to offer:

- [Earn KOII tokens whenever your content is viewed](/concepts/earning-koii/proof-of-real-traffic/attention-mining)
- [Store content as Atomic NFTs using decentralized storage networks](/develop/build-dapps-with-koii/using-nfts-as-content/)
- [Easily integrate wallets from popular blockchains](/develop/build-dapps-with-koii/integrating-wallets/finnie-wallet)
- [Build a Crowdfunding Portal or Leaderboard Social Platform](/develop/build-dapps-with-koii/template-library/)
- [Integrate Koii Tasks for Trustless Back-End Services ](/develop/microservices-and-tasks/what-are-tasks/)
