To deploy a task, see the documentation on our command line tool, [create-task-cli](/develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli/intro), or our [EZSandbox tutorial on deploying a task](https://github.com/koii-network/ezsandbox/blob/main/Lesson%201/PartIV.md).

If you'd like to create a task with a KPL token, check out the next section, [KPL Tokens](/develop/task-development/kpl-tokens.md).
