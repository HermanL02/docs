To deploy a task, see our documentation on [create-task-cli](/develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli/intro) or our [EZSandbox tutorial on deploying a task](https://github.com/koii-network/ezsandbox/blob/main/Lesson%201/PartIV.md). If you'd like to create a task with a KPL token, check out the next section, [KPL Tokens](/develop/task-development/kpl-tokens.md).


# Task Development Flow

Here are articles in this section:

## Fund Task

We offer a [grant program](https://www.koii.network/grants) to help with the initial funding of your task.

## Write Task

For information on how to write a task, see our [EZSandbox guide](https://github.com/koii-network/ezsandbox).

## Compile and Deploy Task

The [deployment lesson](https://github.com/koii-network/ezsandbox/tree/main/Lesson%207) of EZSandbox will walk you through the steps to deploy a task.

## Whitelist Task

Once you've deployed your task, apply to have it [whitelisted](/develop/task-development/whitelist-task.md) so it will displayed on the desktop node for users to run.
