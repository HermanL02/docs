# Task Testing Methods
After developing your task, it is crucial to thoroughly test it to ensure its functionality and reliability. There are three primary methods you can use to test your task:

1. [Jest](/develop/task-development/testing/testing-locally-using-jest)
2. [Unit Test](/develop/task-development/testing/using-unittest)
3. [Easy-Testing](/develop/task-development/testing/easy-testing)
