Koii Tasks are written mostly in JavaScript, but once you understand the basics, you can use any language that compiles to WebAssembly, or deploy tasks using the [ORCA container manager](https://docs.koii.network/concepts/containerized-tasks/orca).

## Tutorial

If you want a more comprehensive tutorial, we created [EZSandbox](https://github.com/koii-network/ezsandbox) with eight step-by-step lessons walking you through the development of several Koii tasks.
