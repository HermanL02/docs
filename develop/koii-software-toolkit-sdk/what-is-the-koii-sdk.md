We have curated a comprehensive Tool Kit to offer robust support for Koii task and node development. This Tool Kit equips developers with essential resources and tools to efficiently create, deploy, and manage Koii tasks and nodes. By exploring our API documentation, you can unlock the full potential of the Koii platform and seamlessly build innovative applications.

Koii provides a diverse range of tools and resources to support you throughout your development journey. Here are some of the essential offerings:

### Web3 SDK

The Web3 SDK is the KOII (K2) JavaScript API, built on the Koii platform. With this SDK, users can access various functionalities such as checking status and fetching information from the K2 network. To explore its usage, you can find more details [here.](./koii-javascript-api)

### Koii CLI

The Koii CLI provides a set of valuable features, including:

- Generating a Koii wallet
- Running Koii test validator

To learn more about the Koii CLI and its functionalities, you can find additional information [here](/develop/category/koii-command-line-tool)

### Create Task CLI

The Create Task CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to deploy your task to a task node in just under 5 minutes! To get started, you can prepare your task by following the guidelines [here](./quickstart/hello-world/introduction) and then try out the Create Task CLI[here.](/develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli)

### Task Node CLI

The Task Node CLI serves as a valuable tool used by node operators for various purposes, offering four key functionalities:

- Create a Task Staking Wallet:
  This feature allows node operators to create a wallet specifically designed for staking tokens related to Koii tasks.

- Create a Distribution Wallet:
  Node operators can use this functionality to generate a wallet dedicated to distributing rewards for Koii tasks.

- Stake Tokens on a Task:
  Using this option, node operators can stake tokens on a particular Koii task, enabling them to participate in the task's network and validation process.

- Show All Tasks:
  This functionality provides node operators with a comprehensive view of all the existing Koii tasks, facilitating better management and oversight.

For detailed information about the Task Node CLI and its capabilities, you can find more details [here](/develop/command-line-tool/task-node-cli).
