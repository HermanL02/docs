**Google Doodle** task is a simple Koii task for retrieving and validating a scrapped doodle. It is a simple Koii task and an excellent way to get started writing Koii tasks.

Let's first understand the logic behind the task before moving on to the coding aspect.

# Google Doodle Task Logic
The latest google doodle is scraped from Google/doodles and submitted to K2.

To validate a node's submission, the most recent Google doodle is retrieved and compared to what was submitted to K2. If it does, the node's submission is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
