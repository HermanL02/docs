**Contact Us** task is a simple Koii task for retrieving and validating a scrapped doodle. It is a simple Koii task and an excellent way to get started writing Koii tasks.

Let's first understand the logic behind the task before moving on to the coding aspect.

:::note
If you're new to creating tasks, it is advisable to go through our [Hello World](/hello-world/introduction) tutorial, as it was written as an introductory tutorial for beginners to learn how to create Koii tasks.

# The Task Logic
The latest Contact us is scraped from Google/doodles and submitted to K2.

To validate a node's submission, the most recent Contact us is retrieved and compared to what was submitted to K2. If it does, the node's submission is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.

:::tip
