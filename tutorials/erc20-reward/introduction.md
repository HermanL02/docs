The ERC20 Reward Task is a Koii Task that issues rewards (ERC20 token) on an EVM chain. This Koii Task is unique because it interacts with a token smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Goerli testnet. This tutorial will guide you on how to manage the distribution of ERC20 token using a Koii task.

# The Task Logic
The ERC20 Reward Task will interact with the token smart contract deployed on Goerli testnet and reward users who run the task with some of the minted tokens. 

# Prerequisite

- Basic knowledge of Solidity
- An Ethereum browser wallet
- Ethereum Testnet account and some test tokens
