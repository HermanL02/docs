# Example Task: Steam Daily Specials

![banner](./img/Example%20Task_%20Steam.png)

**Steam Daily Specials** is a simple Koii task created by our Koii community member Dongyue. It is simple and almost contains every aspect of a Koii task. It is an excellent way to get started writing Koii tasks.

Let's first understand the logic behind the task before moving on to the coding aspect.

# Steam Daily Specials Logic

The latest Steam daily specials are scraped from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com). The data includes the game name, original price, discounted price, and game tags. The list of games will then be stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage and access.
