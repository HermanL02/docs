The ERC20 Reward Task was created to demonstrate how an ERC20 token can be issued as a reward to node runners after successfully running a task. This Koii Task is unique because it interacts with a token smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Goerli testnet. 

This tutorial will guide you on how to manage rewarding users with ERC20 tokens using a Koii task.

# Prerequisite

- Basic knowledge of Solidity
- An Ethereum browser wallet
- Ethereum Testnet account and some test tokens
