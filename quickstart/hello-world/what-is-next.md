**Congratulations!** You are officially a Koii Task creator. ðŸŽ‰

You created an application that lives on the internet and allows you to store data in a decentralized manner. You can now use this application to store any data you want, and it will be stored on the Koii Network.

You can extend your endpoints, add more functionality, and make the application more complex. The journey is just starting!

:::tip

For an advanced app example, check out our [Linktree Tutorial.](/develop/write-a-koii-task/advanced-tutorials/) It guides you to create a basic yet practical Full Stack Application. You can extend the structure to create a decentralized social media running on Web3!
