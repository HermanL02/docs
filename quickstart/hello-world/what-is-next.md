import Tooltip from "@site/src/components/tooltip";

**Congratulations!** You are officially a Koii Task creator and a Web3 Developer. ðŸŽ‰

You created an application that lives on the internet and allows you to store data in a decentralized manner. You can now use this application to store any data you want, forever.

The [Ministry of Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministries_in_Nineteen_Eighty-Four) can no longer change nor censor your data.

You can extend your endpoints, add more functionality, and make the application more complex. The journey is just starting!

In order the understand the user experience better, you can try the <Tooltip text="Koii Node"/> yourself.

We are ready to help on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/koii) with any questions you may have. We are also happy to help you with any problems that you might face and provide feedback on your applications!

For an advanced app example, check out our [Linktree Tutorial.](/tutorials/linktree/intro) It guides you to create a basic yet practical Full Stack Application. You can extend the structure to create a decentralized social platform running on Web3! Or if you want to start from the stratch, check out our [Task Development Guide](/develop/write-a-koii-task/task-development-guide/).

As an alternative to JavaScript, you can build tasks in any language that compiles to WebAssembly, as it can be injected into the existing JavaScript container. [ORCA](/concepts/containerized-tasks/orca) (coming soon) is designed to allow the easy installation of any existing apps within a clean and sandboxed docker container.
