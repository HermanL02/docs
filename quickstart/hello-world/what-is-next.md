**Congratulations!** You are officially a Koii Task creator. ðŸŽ‰

You created an application that lives on the internet and allows you to store data in a decentralized manner. You can now use this application to store any data you want, and it will be stored on the Koii Network.

You can extend your endpoints, add more functionality, and make the application more complex. The journey is just starting!

:::tip

For an advanced app example, check out our [Linktree Tutorial.](/develop/write-a-koii-task/advanced-tutorials/) It guides you to create a basic yet practical Full Stack Application. You can extend the structure to create a decentralized social media running on Web3!

Alternatively, you can build tasks in any language that compiles to WebAssembly, as it can be injected into the existing JavaScript container.

[ORCA](/orca) (coming soon) is designed to allow the easy installation of any existing apps within a clean and sandboxed docker container.

If you're looking for a particular solution, you might want to try one of the templates below:

1. Database Sharing - [Linktree Task Template](/tutorials/linktree/data-sharing)
2. Data Gathering and AI Pre-Processing
3. Private Data

If you've made it this far, you might as well try Koii Desktop Node yourself! Join our globally distributed community. We are ready to help on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/koii)
