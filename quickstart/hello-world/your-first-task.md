## What will we build?

We will start with a fairly simple task, utilizing Koii's global network to serve us a **GET** Endpoint. This guide will be a simple demonstration of how to write and deploy a task.

You will learn:

1. How to write a Koii Task.
2. How to deploy a Koii Task.
3. How to test a Koii Task.

## Possible Usecases

Even in its most basic form, you would have an application **that eternally stores a string.** As long as there are some nodes running your task, the data that you have decided to store (in our case, Hello World) will not get lost.
