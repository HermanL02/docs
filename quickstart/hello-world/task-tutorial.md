# A revolutionary approach to machine learning

You can utilize KOII as your cost-effective solution for training machine learning models. KOII Network leverages the power of consumer hardware and the principles of federated learning to significantly cut costs.

By distributing computational tasks across multiple devices, KOII Tasks reduces the need for expensive hosting options, and also promotes data privacy and efficiency.

**KOII Machine Learning is currently under development.**
