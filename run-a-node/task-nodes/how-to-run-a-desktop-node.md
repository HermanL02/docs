Task nodes can be run by running the Desktop Node. 

The desktop task node makes it easy to earn passive income from your computer while you're asleep. Setup takes 5 minutes or less, and you will receive income for every task your computer does while you're away.

Just want to help? Don't worry, you can also donate your earnings towards scientific and humanitarian efforts - anything from mapping the stars to solving cancer takes compute, and your device is one of billions around the world that can help.
