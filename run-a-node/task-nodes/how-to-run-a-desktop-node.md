Koii is a community of people and computers collaborating to build a brighter, more secure, and more private future. The global network allows anyone to use a few lines of code to access personal computers instead of paying Big Tech™ to do what you need.

We are excited to have you as part of our community and our beta test for powering the next generation of the internet.


# What exactly is a Koii node?

A Koii node is a very small computer program—about the same size as your favorite music player—that allows you to run compute jobs called “tasks” for people around the world. They pay you to rent the extra space, like Uber for your computer, but it stays on your desk at all times.

A task can be anything from hosting a website to cataloging information from the internet, or processing lots of data. The possibilities are endless.

Let’s get started.


# How do I run a node?
The installation process varies depending on your operating system:

- [Windows](#windows-download)
- [Mac](#mac-download)
- [Linux](#)

### Windows Download
If you have Windows, [get this download](https://github.com/koii-network/desktop-node/releases/download/v0.2.2/koii-desktop-node-0.2.2-win.exe).

Some Windows computers have different settings, so you may see different warning messages after you download the file like “The publisher could not be verified. Are you sure you want to run this software?”

If it doesn’t give you the option to “Run Anyway,” you may need to click an arrow or “Learn More” to get that button. If you trust us, click “Run Anyway” then jump down to [Time to Node](#). 

### Mac Download
If you will be running the node on a Mac, you need to know what kind of chip you have, either M1/M2 or Intel.

You can find out your chip information by going to the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen and clicking on “About This Mac.”

If you have an M1 chip, [get this download](https://github.com/koii-network/desktop-node/releases/download/v0.2.2/koii-desktop-node-0.2.2-mac-arm64.dmg). If you have an Intel chip, [get this download](https://github.com/koii-network/desktop-node/releases/download/v0.2.2/koii-desktop-node-0.2.2-mac-x64.dmg).

Once the file has fully downloaded, open it. Your computer will warn you that you downloaded this file from the internet. If you trust us, click “Open Anway.”

A small finder window will pop up. Drag the Koii Node icon on top of the Applications folder icon. Then you can double click the Koii Node icon to open it.
