You made it, are now earning your first $KOII by running tasks on your device.

Once the **Desktop Node** application is ready and you’ve successfully imported your wallet, you can
navigate to the bottom left of your app, and click on Add Task.

By doing so, you’ll get a list of available tasks to run that are compatible with the compute capacity of your device.

You can run multiple tasks at once! Just add your stake amount in the textbox and click on the Run Task button towards the end.

Tip: The higher your stake is, the higher your reputation is going to increase in the network of nodes for higher credibility.
