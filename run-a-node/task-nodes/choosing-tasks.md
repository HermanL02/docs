You made it, and are now earning your first $KOII by running tasks on your device.

Once the **Koii Node** application is ready and you've successfully imported your wallet, you can
navigate to the bottom left of your app, and click on "Add Task". This will show you a list of available tasks to run that are compatible with the computing capacity of your device. You can run multiple tasks at once, feel free to add as many as your computer can handle!

<!-- Tip: The higher your stake is, the higher your reputation is going to increase in the network of nodes for higher credibility. -->
