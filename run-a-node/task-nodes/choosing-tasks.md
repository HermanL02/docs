You made it, you’re almost halfway through earning your first $KOII by running tasks on your device. 

Once the **Desktop Node** application is ready and you’ve successfully imported your wallet. 
Navigate to the bottom left of your app, and click on Add Task
You’ll get a list of available tasks to run that are compatible with the compute capacity of your device. 
Enter your stake amount in the textbox and click on the Run Task button towards the end. 

Tip: The higher your stake is, the higher your reputation is going to increase in the network of nodes for higher credibility.
