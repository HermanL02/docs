Raspberry Pi OS is divided into several versions, including a **full version with a** **desktop environment(#1)**, a version with **a desktop but no recommended software(#2)**, and a **"Lite" version with a command line interface(#3)**.

In this tutorial, I'll go over the installation options for all three versions in detail.
