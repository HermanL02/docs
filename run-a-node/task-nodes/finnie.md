## Download and Use Finnie

1. **Download**: Go to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/finnie/cjmkndjhnagcfbpiemnkdpomccnjblmj" target="_blank">Finnie</a> and install the Finnie Wallet. The wallet is available for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave browsers.

2. **Set-Up**: Once the installation is complete, open the Finnie Wallet app and follow the instructions to set up your wallet. This will include creating a new wallet or importing an existing one, and setting up security features such as a password and backup phrase.

3. **Using Finnie**: Now that your wallet is ready, you can start exploring. Navigate through the different blockchain networks supported, organize your NFTs, mint new items, track attention on your content using KOII tokens, and manage your decentralized identity - all within the wallet.

4. **Finnie and the faucet**: On the [Faucet](https://faucet.koii.network/) page, after you install and activate the Finnie extension for the site, there is a button labeled **Connect Finnie**. Finnie will pop up and ask you to connect to the faucet. Select the wallet you want to connect to and click "Connect". Then your wallet will be connected to the faucet.
