  What is the Koii Node?
</h2>

A Koii Node is a very small computer program—about the same size as your favorite music player—that allows you to run compute jobs called **[tasks](/concepts/what-are-tasks/what-are-tasks/)** for people around the world. They pay you to rent the extra space, like Uber for your computer, but it stays on your desk at all times.

A task can be anything from hosting a website to cataloging information from the internet, or processing lots of data. The possibilities are endless.

Let’s get started!

  How do I run a node?

The installation process varies depending on your operating system:

- [Windows](#windows-download)
- [Mac](#mac-download)
- [Linux](#linux-download)

### Windows Download

If you have Windows, <DownloadLinks os="Windows" />.

Some Windows computers have different settings, so you may see different warning messages after you download the file like “The publisher could not be verified. Are you sure you want to run this software?”

If it doesn’t give you the option to “Run Anyway,” you may need to click an arrow or “Learn More” to get that button. If you trust us, click “Run Anyway” then jump down to [Time to Node](#time-to-node).

### Mac Download

If you will be running the node on a Mac, you need to know what kind of chip you have, either M1/M2 or Intel.

You can find out your chip information by going to the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen and clicking on “About This Mac.”

If you have an M1 or M2 chip, <DownloadLinks os="MacArm" />. If you have an Intel chip, <DownloadLinks os="MacIntel" />.

Once the file has been fully downloaded, open it. Your computer will warn you that you downloaded this file from the internet. If you trust us, click “Open Anyway.”

A small finder window will pop up. Drag the Koii Node icon on top of the Applications folder icon. Then you can double-click the Koii Node icon to open it.

### Linux Download

There are many different Linux configurations, so we won’t get into the specifics here about how to download the node itself.

:::note
If you want your node to update automatically, you must use AppImage, <DownloadLinks os="LinuxUniversal" />
