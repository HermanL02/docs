While there are some tasks you can run immediately, many of them will require you to add task extensions. These are pieces of information that will be used by the task when doing its work.

:::success Whitelisted Tasks are Safe

We take your privacy seriously, which is why your task extensions are saved locally and never transmitted to us.

For example, if you enter your Twitter username and password as task extensions, Twitter-related tasks will use that information to log into Twitter and read tweets - but the task runs on your computer only, so we never see your credentials. Additionally, the tasks do not post to your account.

:::danger Non-Whitelisted Tasks May Not be Safe

Note that only tasks listed in the Add Task section of your node have been whitelisted tasks and reviewed. Running tasks added through the `Advanced` option is at your own risk!

## Adding a Task Extension

To add a task extension, go to the `Add Task` tab and find an extension with an orange gear:

Click on `Select item` beside each extension you need to configure:

From the dropdown that appears, choose `Add New`:

A window will appear, enter your information and click `Save Settings`.

You can confirm your task extension was added successfully by noting that the `Select item` field has changed:

When you've configured all the required extensions, the gear will turn blue and the run button will become active:

## Managing Task Extensions

If you would like to view, update, or delete a task extension value, go to `Task Extensions` under settings:

Each task extension will have buttons for viewing, editing, or deleting:
