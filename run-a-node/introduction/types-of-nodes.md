A node can refer to any device or computer that is connected to a network. Koii Nodes make up the Koii computing cloud network.

There are two types of Koii nodes, each with distinctly different purposes and requirements.

## Task Nodes

Task node operators run compute jobs called "Tasks" to earn rewards. The best way to try out the task node is with the [desktop node](https://koii.network/node).

## K2 Nodes

The K2 Settlement Layer is the core of Koii's network.

In addition to providing [fast and secure micro-payments](/concepts/settlement-layer/k2-tick-tock-fast-blocks) for Koii's [Compute Economy](/koii/ways-to-get-koii/compute-sharing-marketplace/), the K2 layer also provides a heartbeat to [synchronize Task Nodes](/develop/write-a-koii-task/task-development-kit-tdk/using-the-task-namespace/timestamp-round-and-slot), and the apps built on top of them.

Because of this important role, and the responsibility of securing the network, K2 nodes [require significantly more powerful hardware](/run-a-node/k2-nodes/system-requirements), along with considerable collateral deposits to ensure secure.
