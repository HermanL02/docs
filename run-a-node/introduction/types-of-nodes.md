**Nodes** are the backbone of the Koii network. We are trying to build a global, decentralized network that will rival the current monopolies on computing power. By downloading the Koii Node, your laptop can also be a part of our global network that aims to revolutionalize and democratize the world, as a <Tooltip text="Task Node"/> that run Web3 applications.

By choosing to do so, on top of helping developers all kinds of projects, you also will gain rewards in the form of KOII tokens Alternatively, if you have a relatively powerful machine, you can convert it to become a <Tooltip text="K2 Validator"/> which tracks the settlement layer.

:::tip 
As an early adopter, the amount of KOII tokens you will get will be much higher. We are also incentivizing running a node by giving extra rewards via <Tooltip text="Koii Leaderboard"/>.
