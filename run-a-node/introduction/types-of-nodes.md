:::tip In a nutshell
**Nodes** are the backbone of the Koii cloud, and we utilize two distinct types of them. [Task Nodes](/run-a-node/introduction/task-nodes) are ordinary computers that run Web3 applications, and [K2 Nodes](/run-a-node/introduction/k2-nodes) powerful devices that track the settlement layer.

::::info
You can try out the Task Node by downloading the [Koii Desktop Node](https://koii.network/node) and following the [tutorial](/run-a-node/task-nodes/how-to-run-a-desktop-node).
