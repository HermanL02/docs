Task node operators run compute jobs called <Tooltip text="tasks"/> to earn <Tooltip text="rewards"/>. The best way to try out the task node is with the <Tooltip text="desktop node"/>.

Task nodes serve as the fundamental infrastructure for executing Koii tasks, assuming a pivotal role in their successful implementation. Notably, these nodes are efficiently hosted on personal devices, ensuring widespread accessibility by virtually any user.

An essential characteristic of task nodes is the incorporation of <Tooltip text="local databases"/>., wherein crucial data is securely stored. Koii introduces a pioneering concept called <Tooltip text="database sharing"/>, enabling task nodes to seamlessly synchronize and update their data at regular intervals. This mechanism not only fosters the overall system's coherence but also enhances its accuracy and reliability.
