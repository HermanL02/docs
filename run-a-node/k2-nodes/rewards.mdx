The rewards you can earn when running a validator for Koii, like any <Tooltip text="Proof of Stake"/> (PoS) blockchain, can vary based on several factors. Koii uses a PoS consensus mechanism known as <Tooltip text="Proof of History"/> (PoH), combined with Proof of Stake (PoS), where token holders can delegate their tokens to validators who secure the network and validate transactions.

The rewards you can earn as a validator on Koii primarily depend on the following factors:

**Stake Amount**: The more Koii tokens (KOII) you have staked or delegated, the higher your potential rewards. Validators with a larger stake typically earn more rewards compared to those with smaller stakes.

**Network Participation**: Validators that actively participate in the consensus process by producing blocks and validating transactions have a higher chance of earning rewards. Reliable and well-connected validators tend to receive more block rewards.

**Performance and Uptime**: Koii rewards validators based on their performance and uptime. Validators that consistently maintain a high uptime and contribute to network stability are more likely to receive rewards.

**Competition and Network Load**: The number of validators in the network and the overall network load can impact your rewards. If there are fewer validators competing for rewards or if the network has low transaction volumes, individual validators may earn more rewards.
