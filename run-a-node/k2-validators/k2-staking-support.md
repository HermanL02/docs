## Koii Foundation Support for K2 Validators

The Koii Foundation is here to support K2 Validators. 

Koii is intended to be a decentralized and open network, and supporting the underdog is in our genome. Giving every validator a chance makes the network more open, more decentralized, and ensures fair participation for everyone. 

** We understand that running a validator can be expensive. **

If you are running a K2 Node and are having a hard time making ends meet, the Koii Foundation can delegate KOII to your node. 

### Process for Receiving Support
1. **Setup Your K2 Validator**: Follow our detailed documentation to set up your K2 validator.
2. **Engage with the Community**: Post in the `#k2-validator` channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/koii-network) to seek community support.
3. **Submit the Application Form**: Fill out the [Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbkcD5kddmo-ir_LC1eNdqRdrzmHTf5oS9HKaYowhDE67SXw/viewform) with your Discord handle included.
4. **Complete KYC Requirements**: Verify your identity and/or your business to comply with regulatory standards.
5. **Schedule an Introductory Call**: Wait to be contacted for an introductory call with a member of the Koii Foundation team.
6. **Receive Delegated Stake**: Upon successful review, receive delegated stake and commence running your node.

### Continued Support
The Koii Foundation is dedicated to providing ongoing support to our validators to ensure the robustness and scalability of the network. We believe that by empowering each participant, we can achieve a truly decentralized ecosystem.
