## Tech Words:

 **Namespace**: In programming, a namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers, such as variable and function names
 , and allows them to be distinguished from others that might have the same name but are in a different namespace. In this context, it refers to a specific set of functions or methods within the task-node that are used for managing the distribution list.

## Error Code:

 **Code 429**: Error code 429 typically indicates that the user has exceeded the rate limit, which is often encountered in scenarios where an API or service is **accessed too frequently within a given time frame**. It's not typically associated with a low internet connection. In the context of Twitter, this error suggests that the user's actions are being temporarily restricted due to an excessive number of requests or submissions in a short period.  

It would be beneficial to inquire if the user is operating multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously or engaging in actions that could trigger the platform's rate-limiting mechanisms. To resolve this issue, **it's advisable for the user to halt any ongoing tasks or interactions with Twitter for a few hours before attempting to access the service again**. This pause can help reset the account's request count and potentially avoid further rate-limiting errors.
