## Q: Didn't Koii use to use web3.storage? Why did we switch to Spheron?

The web3.storage did an upgrade and **no longer has the free tier** which means you will need to have a credit card in order to have a web3.storage key.

So we did a partnership with **Spheron** to allow users to have easy one click integration without requiring any credit card.

## Q: Where do I find my Spheron Key after it's set up?

You can find your **storage key** here:
