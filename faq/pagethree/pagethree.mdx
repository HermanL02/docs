 **Namespace**: In programming, a namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers, such as variable and function names
 , and allows them to be distinguished from others that might have the same name but are in a different namespace. In this context, it likely refers to a specific set of functions or methods within the task-node that are used for managing the distribution list.
