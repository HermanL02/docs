## How to Whitelist Your Task

To get your task whitelisted, follow these steps:


### 1. Test Locally
Begin by testing your task on your local environment to ensure it functions correctly. 

### 2. Use the Advanced Task Feature
Before submitting your application for the whitelisting process, it's recommended to first take advantage of the Advanced Task feature available on the node. This feature permits you to create and run your custom task even before obtaining official whitelisting. By navigating to the **Add Task** section and selecting **+ Advanced**, you can set up your task. After creating it, sharing this task with friends is a great way to conduct additional testing and gather feedback.
### 3. Apply for Whitelisting
To have your task appear on the whitelisted tasks list, take the following actions:
  - Make your repository **public** or share it directly with the Koii team.
  - Open a **support ticket on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/koii-network)** to initiate the whitelisting process. 

### Note
During this process, our team will create a dedicated GitHub account for holding your project.
