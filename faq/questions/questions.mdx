## Q: I accidently delete my Spheron storage key, how to get another one?

1. **Setting up a new account** and generating a new key will be the **easiest** way, then you can switch back to using your newly generated key for your previous account.

2. Also, you can easily **transfer** your KOII tokens from your Koii node application to your Finnie wallet. And then transfer them to your new account and keep mining.

3. Additionally, they can **follow this tutorial**: [Click Here](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to get a new one and manually insert it.

## Q: I accidentally clicked on the devnet. how can I open again my Koii app/node?

**For Mac**: Delete this file and start the node ~/Library/Application Support/desktop-node/config.json

**For Linux**: Delete this file and start the node ~/.config/desktop-node/config.json

## Q: My task failed at: Start task/Upgrade task/accidentally close the Koii Node and lead to stake token gone. Where should I find them?

If you believe that your KOII is lost, it would be a good idea to check your staking balance first. If your KOII is there you can follow the instructions on the image to send those KOII back to your main wallet.

## Q: What's the suggest balance I should at lease have in staking wallet?

It varies on the amount of data you will hold, so if you are running more task, you will be storing more data in staking wallet.

**Around 7 KOII** is sufficient for 1mb of rent exemption, though if you have more data and less KOII than rent exemption you will need to pay rent ~0.0047 KOII per epoch per mb.

## Q: Why I don’t I have permission to check the main.log when a error occurred in my task? How to fix it?

It should be the permission issue, try run it as **Administrator** and try again.

## Q: I have an issue of my KOII stuck in the stake box, they can neither take it back nor use them to run the task. What should I do?

We noted this issue(**token stuck in the box**), Will patch this in the next version.

Somehow your task ended in the available tasks, but you still have some KOII staked. Your KOII are safe and staked in the task. Its just a UI issue that when you trying to click play button it is trying to stake KOII again and since you doesn't had that much KOII so you is not able to stake it again.

## Q: I created wallet when Koii was on K1 (Arweave based KOII) but as Koii has migrated to k2 (Solana forked Koii), what should I do to get my tokens back.

You **cannot keep use your old key phrase to retrieve the wallet**, Older keys run on Arweave. If your key was created before K2, select Arweave for import.

## Q: Lost a lot of tokens overnight (not in my staking key).

The problem is you may **stake too many KOII** on a single task, and might have get slashed, most tasks currently are not really dependent on the stake amount currently, so staking more won't get you more KOII for these tasks (In future there will be such tasks).

For safety you can also have another cold wallet that you don't use with the KOII node, and then you can **transfer all the amount that is not in use to that cold wallet and only use the node wallet as hot wallet for all the tasks running and staking**

## Q: I have issue with unable to claim rewards or unstake my KOII.

The issue is **you doesn’t have enough KOII to pay for the transaction fees** of unstake and claim rewards.
Please **not to empty your main wallet completely**, just put some KOII so that it can cover for transaction fees like submitting data for task, claiming reward, unstaking, etc.

## Q: I am trying to run twitter tasks for a while now but keeps facing this issue "Password is incorrect or email verification needed".

please open an **incognito** window, go to twitter login page and use your username(not email or phone number), and password to log in to twitter. You might faced a reCAPTCHA from twitter. After any verification such as email or phone number and you can log in without the verification, use Koii Node and try to run the task again.

## Q: Will the mainnet token will be distributed 1:1 for node runners?

Yes, the only exception is in cases where fraud or other nefarious activity is detected.

## Q: I changed computer, can I sync my old Koii node with my new Koii nodes?

**On VPS**: We don't have the support as of now for the seeds of staking_wallet (Will add in future).  
**On PC**: What you should have done is backup the private key of staking_wallet which is found under <path_to_k2_vps_repo>/namespace/staking_wallet.json and as for the main wallet that is the one created using koii-keygen
(Also outputs the seed phrase for you to store) and can be found under koii config get command KeyPair Path.

## Q: Where do I find my Spheron Key after it's set up?

You can find your storage key here:

## Q: I do not having enough KOII for gas fees when staking full numbers.

**Reserve Tokens for Gas Fees**: Before staking all your KOII tokens, ensure you reserve a small portion of them to cover the gas fees. 

**Acquire Additional KOII**: You can acquire additional KOII tokens to cover the gas fees. Please reserve at least 7 KOII in you staking key

**Stake in Smaller Amounts**: Instead of staking the entire amount at once, consider staking smaller portions. This way, the gas fees for each transaction will be lower
, and you can ensure that enough tokens are left to cover these fees.

## Q: Didn't Koii used to use web3.storage? Why did we switch to Spheron?

The web3.storage did an upgrade and no longer have the free tier which means you will need to have a credit card in order to have a web3.storage key.

So we did a partnership with Spheron to allow users to have easy one click integration without requiring any credit card.

## Q: I have a problem when I claim the rewards.

So far all the problems here are visual, please **wait a while** after clicking to claim reward and **then refreshing** will solve the problem.

## Warning 
1. Please do not delete the Spheron key as it is not recoverable.

2. Please double check if your **Twitter information** is correct. (i.e. setting Spheron key for twitter username, password, and phone) 

## Q: If I stake more on tasks do I get bigger rewards?

 The decision to offer larger rewards for higher stakes depends on each task creator's policy. Although no active tasks currently use stake size as a reward modifier, task creators might implement this feature to encourage greater participation or investment in their tasks. It can serve as an incentive for contributors to engage more significantly with the task, potentially leading to higher quality submissions or more robust involvement. However, our platform typically operates on a standard deposit model. Should task creators choose to offer such incentives, they can do so (e.g., 1.1x reward for stakes over 100 KOII) using the smart contract functionality.
