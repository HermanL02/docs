## How to Whitelist Your Task

To get your task whitelisted, follow these steps:


### 1. Test Locally
Begin by testing your task on your local environment to ensure it functions correctly. 

### 2. Use the Advanced Task Feature
It's recommended to make use of the Advanced Task feature available on the node. This functionality enables you to design and run your own custom task even before you receive official whitelisting. To initiate your task, navigate to the **Add Task** section and choose the **+ Advanced** option. Additionally, sharing your task with friends offers a fantastic opportunity for further testing and obtaining valuable feedback.
### 3. Apply for Whitelisting
To have your task appear on the whitelisted tasks list, take the following actions:
  - Make your repository **public** or share it directly with the Koii team.
  - Open a **support ticket on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/koii-network)** to initiate the whitelisting process. Please also provide the link to your public repository as well as your Task ID.

### Note
During this process, our team will create a dedicated GitHub account for holding your project.
