While the task standard supports a wide range of possible applications, the most straightforward approach is to follow a multi-round confirmation process, which we refer to as **Gradual Consensus**.

## **Why is it gradual?**

One of the major limitations of stake-based games is the potential for an actor with a large amount of tokens to temporarily take over the system and potentially even extract rewards unfairly. Koii tasks naturally avoid this issue by slowing down reward distributions and using proportionately high numbers of audit nodes compared to task executors.

## **How does it work?**

The key to building community-based products is to regularly appraise contributions through a commonly agreed on set of rules. Under the Koii model, this system runs in [regularly timed rounds](#the-task-lifecycle), during which each participating device participates as much as it can, and rewards or penalties are regularly deployed to correct the course of the system towards a desired outcome.

For help designing your task, you might want to try using the task organizer, which provides a simple whiteboard for brainstorming your product.

Note: In most cases, the actual management of (3) and (4) above depends on [tracking digital signatures](/) from participating nodes, community members, or outside oracle services. Reviewing these signatures is usually referred to as an [_audit_](/).

Gradual consensus is a multi-round game under which nodes first perform a task, and then vote on a reward distribution. It's important to understand that while the process takes three rounds to complete, each cycle operates independently once per round, such that there is always one cycle starting and completing within every round.
