## The Power of Collective Computing

AI applications require massive computing resources to handle complex algorithms and process large datasets. Koii addresses this challenge by creating a network of real people who collectively contribute their computing power to the platform. By pooling the computational capabilities of our users' computers using our Desktop Node, we create a distributed infrastructure capable of handling sophisticated AI tasks without the need for centralized GPU centers. This decentralized approach not only ensures cost-effectiveness but also enhances scalability and flexibility for users of all sizes, from individuals to enterprises.

## Democratizing AI Data Access

Data is the lifeblood of AI, and access to high-quality datasets can be a major barrier for many AI projects. Koii consists of real individuals who, with proper consent, contribute to collecting data using their accounts. This decentralized data-sharing model allows AI researchers and developers to access diverse datasets that are otherwise hard to obtain.
