# Tokenomics
![banner](tokenomics/img/NETWORK%20ECONOMICS.svg)

Koii is a decentralized protocol, meaning that anyone is free to fork the code and build their own version for a specific purpose. In our first implementation, the [settlement layer](/develop/settlement-layer/k2-tick-tock-fast-blocks) provides [payments processing](/) and [dispute resolution](/develop/designing-tasks/securing-task) services to support the compute economy, while providing a historical ledger. Since the settlement layer is decentralized, there is no central ownership body, and following from the examples of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, a tokenized model was implemented to ensure bad actors can be appropriately penalized. Transaction fees paid in KOII tokens control how data is added to the network, preventing a bad actor from flooding the system with spam.&#x20;

**Note:** The token does not confer governance rights, nor does it provide any ownership of the system. Ownership of tokens does permit a community member to run either a [K2 node](/develop/settlement-layer/running-a-k2-node) or a [task node](/run-a-node/introduction/task-nodes), and provide services to the network.
