## Task Nodes

These nodes complete “objectives” to do whatever is necessary to build a full-fledged dApp

## K2

Koii’s own high-speed settlement layer that processes secure payments quickly and reliably. The settlement layer is made of task nodes (K1) built on top of storage networks.

## Decentralized Storage

This is where data is stored on a decentralized network by users or groups who are incentivized to join, store, and keep data accessible. This is a peer-to-peer network of users who hold a portion of the overall data, creating an adaptable file storage sharing system.

## Koii Nodes

A downloadable computer program that allows programmers to use some of their computer processing power to accomplish tasks

## Task Nodes

Task Nodes help keep the network running smoothly by executing tasks that are requested from the network

## Proofs of Real Traffic, aka PoRT

Proof of Real-Traffic is Koii’s attention tracking system. This is the way creators get rewarded for their work and published content.

## Finnie

The official wallet of Koii Network, which enables users to create, store, manage, and share digital assets across different blockchain ecosystems

## Koii SDK

The Software Development Kit that supports the creation of Koii Tasks, Nodes, and Koii-X templates

## Koii CLI

The Koii CLI (Command Line Interface) is a software tool provided by the Koii Network that allows developers to interact with the Koii blockchain network via the command line

## KOII Faucet

An online KOII token dispenser designed for people to get a small amount of free tokens

## KOII Task
- <h3 style={{marginTop: '0px'}}> Task Template </h3>

A framework that allows a developer to create tasks easily and quickly

- ### Create a Task

Creating a task usually happens when developers use “Create-task-CLI” to package their task code to task node and upload the task configuration information to IPFS

- ### Deploy a Task

The allow-list process for other people to run that task from their personal devices

# General Computing Terms
<h2 style={{marginTop: '0px'}}> An Application Programming Interface (API) </h2>

A way for two or more programs to communicate with each other.

## REST API - A subset of APIs

A public set of functions exposed by a server to allow third parties to interact with it. For example, the Google Images API allows an image to be uploaded to find similar images through a reverse search.

## SDK (Software Development Kit)

A set of tools provided by a software company to allow developers to work with their systems
<br/>
<br/>

# Web3 terms
<h2 style={{marginTop: '0px'}}> Consensus </h2>

A general agreement; consensus is achieved when all participants of the network agree on the order and content in a decentralized manner

## Blockchain

A publicly-accessible digital ledger used to store and transfer information without the need for a central authority

## Decentralization

The distribution of control and decision-making from central authority, to a distributed network of power

## Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

A distributed and encoded database that serves as a ledger where transaction records are stored

## Block

A collection of information on transactions completed during a given period of time

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

Used to describe the interactions between parties, in which they disperse tasks and workloads

## Minting

The process of authenticating data, creating new tokens, and bringing them into circulation onto a blockchain using a Proof-of-Stake process

## Mining

The process of earning crypto by recording and verifying transactions on the blockchain

## Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

A method used by blockchain protocols to achieve distributed consensus. It is an upgrade from Proof-of-Work that uses much less processing power by using a select few of validators

## Validator

A node in a proof-of-stake system that is responsible for processing transactions, storing data, and adding new blocks to the blockchain

## Proof-of-Work (PoW)

A consensus algorithm in a blockchain used by miners who then complete tasks to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the chain. It has less decentralization because of mining pools, and requires a huge amount of processing power per miner

## NFT (Non-Fungible Token)

A digital certificate of authenticity used to assign and verify ownership of a unique digital or physical asset. Unlike fungible tokens, NFTs are not interchangeable with one another.

## Fungible Token

An asset on a blockchain that is interchangeable with another asset - cryptocurrencies are a great example because each coin has the same value as any other coin of the same type

## Settlement Layer

A layer that essentially provides an anchor for an entire ecosystem

## Wallet

A software application or hardware device used to store the private keys to blockchain assets, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It stores the private key that proves ownership of a given digital asset

## Wallet Address (aka Public Key)

Usually a string of numbers that serves as the address for a blockchain wallet, similar to a bank account number. The Wallet Address is how you send transactions to a Key.

## Private Key

As opposed to a public key, a private key is the confidential code you use to access your wallet where your cryptocurrencies are stored. NEVER share your private key with anyone.

## Web3

The next iteration of the web where there is no centralized authority, and restored ownership of data and information to users. Also known as the ‘read-write-trust web,’ Web 3 is the replacement of ‘read-write’ (Web2) and its predecessor “read only” (Web1).

## Secret Phrase aka Seed Phrase/Recovery Phrase

A sequence of randomly generated words that gives you access to your crypto within a wallet

## Decentralized Finance (DEFI)

Peer-to-peer financial service on public blockchains - uses emerging technology to remove intermediaries in financial transactions by using smart contracts on a blockchain

## Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

A peer-to-peer exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a mediator

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

A network of people with no central leadership, and is collectively owned and governed by its members

## Signature (Cryptographic Signature)

A mathematical operation that allows someone to prove their ownership of their wallet, coin, or data

## Key Pair

A combination of a public key and a private key that helps encrypt information that guarantees data is protected at a higher security level

## Whitepaper

A document crypto projects release the provide investors with technical information about its purpose

## Wrapped Tokens

A token that represents a cryptocurrency from another blockchain that is fixed to the value of the original cryptocurrency it represents

## Wrapped NFTs

The ability to build an NFT on top of another NFT where the initial NFT is wrapped in a contract underneath the new NFT. It introduces the opportunity to develop an existing project.

## Airdrop

When a project has a giveaway for either tokens or coins, and can also be NFTs

## ERC-721

Known as NFTs, this allows developers to classify owned arbitrary data as a valid token

## ERC-20
A token standard that allows the Application Programming Interface (API) to be implemented for cryptocurrencies. This makes it so every token possesses the same form and value, and grants the exchange, sharing, and transferring of new tokens into a crypto wallet.

## Staking

The process of putting your tokens in a proof-of-stake system to serve as a validator to the blockchain and receive incentives

## Stablecoins

A cryptocurrency with low volatility

## Altcoin
All other cryptocurrency coins other than Bitcoin

## Testnet aka “Test Network”

A network used to stimulate the behavior of the mainnet. This is where developers can test the performance of new protocols before making them public.

## Mainnet aka “Main Network”

The main public version of a blockchain that is fully developed
## Bytecode

A form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter
