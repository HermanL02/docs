Whether you're designing building an Artificial Intelligence, a simple full stack application, or revolutionary social media app hosted by its users, Koii's community cloud can provide cost and security benefits. It allows you to build autonomous applications that wouldn't be possible via classical server architectures.

We designed an open standard called [**Gradual Consensus**](/develop/koii-task-101/what-are-tasks/gradual-consensus), and built the Desktop Node that allows an ordinary computer to become a web server by running [**Tasks**](/develop/koii-task-101/what-are-tasks/).

Depending on the size of the community, volunteer task operators may be sufficient to power the product, or a [grant can be requested](https://share.hsforms.com/16Xmwya9wQcClwavDXdtlJQc20dg) to cover initial KOII tokens to pay for early bounties.&#x20;
