Data sharding refers to a technique used to distribute and partition data across multiple nodes in order to improve scalability and performance.

Koii tasks implement data sharding to divide the network's data into multiple shards and distribute them across different nodes. Each node would be responsible for storing and processing a specific shard of the data.

This approach allows for parallel processing of data and reduces the burden on individual nodes, leading to improved performance and scalability.
