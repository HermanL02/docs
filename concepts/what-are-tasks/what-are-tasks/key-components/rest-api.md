Developing REST APIs is a fundamental aspect of any Koii task. These APIs are designed to handle incoming requests, perform data processing operations, and provide appropriate responses to the client.

Regardless of the specific task being undertaken, the implementation of REST APIs allows for the establishment of a standardized communication protocol. This enables clients to interact with the server by making HTTP requests, such as retrieving or modifying data.

By creating well-defined APIs, developers can ensure a structured and efficient flow of information between the client and server. This approach promotes modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance, making it a crucial component of various projects within the Koii ecosystem.

This concept is implemented in our [Hello World](/quickstart/hello-world/introduction) and [Linktree tutorial](/quickstart/linktree/intro).
