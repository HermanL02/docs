# Koii Tasks

![banner](<../img/_What%20are%20tasks_%20(1).svg>)

Building truly decentralized systems requires a complicated mix of incentive, engineering, and cryptography.

<Tooltip text="Gradual Consensus"/> in Koii Tasks standardize this structure to provide a single community cloud toolkit for all purposes.

## Fundamentals

Whether you're building a database, newsfeed, federated learning network, or a storage and caching service, you'll need the same three components.

1. ** Incentives **
2. ** Fraud Prevention **
3. ** Synchronization **

Koii tasks are off-chain computations that are verified and submitted on-chain, then audited by other nodes. This unique structure of accountability allows task nodes to perform a range of easily customizable services, providing a flexible and efficient foundation for a wide range of applications.

<p>Koii provides a microservices economy to app developers, where nodes trustlessly complete off-chain executables, and return the results on-chain. Witness nodes track this process, verifying the work, and auditing any malicious parties.</p>
