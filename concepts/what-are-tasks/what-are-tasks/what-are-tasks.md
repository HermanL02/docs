Building truly decentralized systems requires a complicated mix of incentive, engineering, and cryptography.

<Tooltip text="Gradual Consensus"/> in Koii Tasks standardizes this structure to provide a single community cloud toolkit for all purposes.

## Fundamentals

Whether you're building a database, news feed, federated learning network, or a storage and caching service, you'll need the same three components.

1. **Incentives**
2. **Fraud Prevention**
3. **Synchronization**

Koii tasks are off-chain computations that are verified and submitted on-chain, then audited by other nodes. This unique structure of accountability allows task nodes to perform a range of easily customizable services, providing a flexible and efficient foundation for a wide range of applications.

Koii provides a microservices economy to app developers, where nodes trustlessly complete off-chain executables, and return the results on-chain. Witness nodes track this process, verifying the work, and auditing any malicious parties.
