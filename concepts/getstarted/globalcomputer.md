## A cloud for people, by people

Since Ethereum's debut in 2015, the idea of a World Computer has captured the imagination of millions around the world. A digital cloud system hosted by the community itself, in many ways, is the solution to the inequality caused by the growing centralization in our modern world.

For too long, power has been concentrated to just a small part of the world's population. The internet has the power to fix this, but not the way it's been built so far.

In the last years, we have slowly witnessed the monopolization of what used the be "the new frontier", small communities gradually lost their power, and now and almost all the processing power and daily applications we use have concentrated in the hands of a few, who control the flow of the knowledge. With arbitrary decisions, they can change their policies overnight, and people, who are the reason why those platforms are valuable in the first place, would be powerless to fight back. Not anymore.

KOII aims to challenge this monopoly, by creating an alternative web hosted by its users. It allows you to become a part of something greater just by running it on your laptop. For developers, it offers an easy way to develop Web3 applications, simply via utilizing Javascript.
