KOII aims to democratize the internet by building a revolutionary global information network.

Ancient civilizations had information networks, too. The ancient internet wasn't fast, but language, art, and culture have always allowed our species to share knowledge and learn from one another. Occasionally, someone exaggerated a bit, and an iguana became a dragon in myth, but mostly it worked okay.

As technologies have advanced, from printing presses, to radio antennae, to modern 5G and mobile devices, the power of the network has grown exponentially. At the same time, democracy has emerged as the de-facto form of governance, elevating mass communication networks and those who control them and creating a massive power imbalance for the rest of us.

Koii is designed to return that power back to the people. We are the network, after all. We just need to pool enough computers, and we can quickly replace social media, publishing, news, and even artificial intelligence with community owned-and-operated alternatives. Beyond edge computing being better for the environment, it's also a whole lot less expensive to use existing consumer hardware than to build new data centers.

Ethereum and other payments networks have paved the way for decentralized commerce, but many of the tools were missing, and decentralized systems require complex game theory to engineer security. Koii is designed from the ground up to make it easy to build fast, scalable, and private systems, hosted across our community cloud.
