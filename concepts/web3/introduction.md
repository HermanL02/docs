# Introduction to practical benefits of Web3 via KOII

## Cut out the middle-man, and get paid fairly for your work

If you have existing content online, such as a blog, website, or app, you can use the developer kit to track attention on your content and mine KOII for every view.

Now, more than ever, the power of content creation and ownership is being democratized by Koii. You are no longer just a number in the big data universe, where your efforts are monetized by big corporations. With Koii, you can truly harness your potential by keeping the rights to your own content and earning value for every engagement your work receives. Privacy is no longer compromised, and your data remains in your hands, marking a paradigm shift in how online content is traditionally handled.

For those with an existing online presence, whether it's a blog, website, or app, the journey with Koii begins with its robust developer kit. This kit equips you with the power to monitor and track user attention on your content and mine KOII tokens with every view. As you engage more with your audience, the KOII rewards keep accumulating, directly proportional to the attention your content garners. Say goodbye to traditional models of ad revenue and welcome the dawn of decentralized content ownership and valuation.
