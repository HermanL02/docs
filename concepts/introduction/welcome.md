<Description text="We built Koii to make a better world by connecting the people that live in it." />

Since Ethereum's debut in 2015, the idea of a **World Computer** has captured the imagination of millions around the world. The benefits of a trustless digital machine with inherent censorship resistance are, in many ways, the answer to the growing pains and civil unrest as our societies struggle to adapt to the realities of global communication via the internet.

Our mission at Koii is to produce better decentralized applications, and make it easier for developers and community members to participate at every level. Our ambition is that tools like Ethereum, Filecoin, and others can be easily accessed and paid for by anyone around the world using simplified templates and tools. &#x20;

The first step in this process was to build a format for anonymous and decentralized trust in product operations, so we designed an open standard called [**Gradual Consensus**](/develop/koii-task-101/what-are-tasks/gradual-consensus), and implemented a prototype called [**Tasks**](/develop/koii-task-101/what-are-tasks/).

Depending on the size of the community, volunteer task operators may be sufficient to power the product, or a [grant can be requested](https://share.hsforms.com/16Xmwya9wQcClwavDXdtlJQc20dg) to cover initial KOII tokens to pay for early bounties.&#x20;
