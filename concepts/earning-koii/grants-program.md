# Grants Program

The Koii Foundation also gives grants to developers and anyone who wants to build new and more rewarding online experiences.&#x20;

Grants are given for helping build core technology, proofs of concept for novel applications of the technology, or other initiatives that make the network grow faster or stronger.

**Note:** Koii grants are in our native compute credits, KOII, and can only be redeemed to use the network, not sold to fund operations.&#x20;

Use the form below to submit your application, or [reach out to the team ](mailto:hello@koii.network)for more information!
