# Koii Network Documentation

## üåê Project Overview

Koii Network is a groundbreaking decentralized infrastructure project aimed at democratizing the internet by creating a community-owned and operated network that provides scalable, secure, and cost-effective computing resources.

### Mission
To empower individuals by creating a decentralized computing ecosystem that returns control and value to its participants through innovative blockchain technology and community-driven infrastructure.

### Key Features
- **Decentralized Cloud Computing**: Harness consumer hardware to build a global, community-powered network
- **Gradual Consensus**: An innovative open standard for secure, distributed computing
- **Task-Based Architecture**: Flexible framework for building decentralized applications
- **Cost-Effective Solutions**: Reduce infrastructure costs by leveraging community-owned resources
- **Privacy and Security**: Built-in mechanisms to protect user data and ensure network integrity
