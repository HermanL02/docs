The Koii tokenomics universe is anchored by a initial total supply of 10 billion KOII tokens, ensuring scarcity and long-term value stability. Inflation begins at an initial rate of 5%, gradually tapering by 15% annually until it stabilizes at a terminal rate of 1.5%. This controlled inflation mechanism supports early network growth while ensuring stability as the network matures.
This total supply is split into circulating and non-circulating components. The circulating supply reflects the active tokens in the ecosystem, while the non-circulating supply includes reserves for network incentives, development, and other foundational activities.

Along with the usual inflation, K2 introduces an account rent mechanism.
Every account holding data on the chain must pay rent unless it holds a sufficient amount of KOII to qualify as rent-exempt. This ensures efficient use of storage resources and promotes active participation in the ecosystem. Together, these elements create a balanced tokenomic model, fostering both short-term participation and long-term ecosystem health.
