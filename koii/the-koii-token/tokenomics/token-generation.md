import Tooltip from "@site/src/components/tooltip";

At <Tooltip text='Mainnet launch'/>, the network will have a supply of 10,000,000,000 KOII, after which an inflation rate of **3.65%** will be issued annually.

:::info In Practice
Every 12 hours, 500,000 new tokens (0.005% of the total supply) are minted for the community.

:::

The newly generated tokens are split between <Tooltip text='Attention Mining'/>, <Tooltip text='K2 Validators'/> and <Tooltip text='Task Nodes'/> that run the attention game.

Attention mining receives 80% of new tokens, K2 settlement layer nodes receive 10%, and task nodes receive 10%. This ensures that content creators who use Koii Network are rewarded fairly.
