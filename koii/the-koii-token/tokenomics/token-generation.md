The Koii network introduces a robust tokenomics framework starting with an initial total supply of 10 billion KOII tokens. This ensures scarcity and supports the long-term value of the tokens. Inflation kicks off at 5% initially and decreases by 15% annually, settling at a terminal inflation rate of 1.5%. This diminishing inflation rate is designed to bolster early network growth while promoting stability as the ecosystem evolves.

The token supply is divided into circulating and non-circulating portions. The circulating supply represents the tokens actively used within the ecosystem, while the non-circulating supply encompasses reserves allocated for network incentives, development, and foundational operations.

In addition to the standard inflationary measures, Koii introduces a unique account rent mechanism. Every account that stores data on the chain must either pay rent or hold enough KOII tokens to achieve rent-exempt status, ensuring efficient utilization of storage resources and encouraging active ecosystem participation.

Further enhancing the tokenomics, Koii implements a mechanism where 50% of gas fees are burned. This policy not only mitigates the effect of inflation as transaction volume increases but also introduces a deflationary aspect to the economy over time, promoting long-term sustainability and health of the network.
