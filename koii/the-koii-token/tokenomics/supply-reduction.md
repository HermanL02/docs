While early cryptocurrencies aimed to provide hard caps, like the Bitcoin network, modern <Tooltip text="Utility Networks"/> have evolved to optimize for network value creation instead.

In Koii’s case, continuous inflation **benefits the network** by onboarding new <Tooltip text="Node Operators"/> who fulfill tasks and provide hosting for content and apps running on Koii. As a result, reducing inflation would actually reduce the rate of new nodes that can join the network, and so steady-state inflation is desirable.&#x20;

The <Tooltip text="Koii Foundation"/> is dedicated to providing developers with incentives to build on the network, including <Tooltip text="Grants"/> and easy-to-use <Tooltip text="Tools"/>. Each time that a new project launches on Koii, a <Tooltip text="Bounty"/> must be locked to pay for hosting from Koii’s <Tooltip text="Compute Marketplace"/>, which removes tokens from the circulating supply. Additionally, each time that a new node joins the task, it must <Tooltip text="Stake"/> tokens as collateral, locking up further supply.&#x20;

At steady state, the network is designed to lock up tokens in staking and bounties, exceeding those released by the inflation, which should reduce the available supply over time.
