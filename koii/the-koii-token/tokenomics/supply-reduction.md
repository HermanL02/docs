While early cryptocurrencies aimed to provide hard caps, like the Bitcoin network, modern utility networks have evolved to optimize for network value creation instead.

In Koii’s case, continuous inflation **benefits the network** by onboarding new <Tooltip text="node operators"/> who fulfill tasks and provide hosting for content and apps running on Koii. As a result, reducing inflation would reduce the rate of new nodes that can join the network, so steady-state inflation is desirable.

The <Tooltip text="Koii Foundation"/> is dedicated to providing developers with incentives to build on the network, including <Tooltip text="grants"/> and easy-to-use tools.

Each time that a new project launches on Koii, a bounty must be locked to pay for hosting from Koii’s compute marketplace, which removes tokens from the circulating supply. Additionally, each time that a new node joins the task, it must stake tokens as collateral, locking up further supply.

At a steady state, the network is designed to lock up tokens in staking and bounties, exceeding those released by inflation, which should reduce the available supply over time.
