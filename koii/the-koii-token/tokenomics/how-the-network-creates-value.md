When a Koii task is run, node operators are required to stake tokens, which locks up the tokens for a specific period.

This staking mechanism serves two purposes: it enhances the security and integrity of the network by ensuring that validators have a stake in maintaining the network's consensus, and it reduces the available token supply in circulation.

The reduction in token supply, coupled with the increasing demand for KOII tokens due to network usage and adoption, can positively impact the token's value.

Furthermore, transactions and interactions with various network services in the Koii Network incur fees that are paid in KOII tokens.

As the network's usage and adoption grow, the demand for KOII tokens to pay for these transaction fees also increases. Users need to acquire and hold KOII tokens to access and utilize the network's services effectively.
