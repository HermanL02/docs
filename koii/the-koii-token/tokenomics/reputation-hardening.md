:::tip In a nutshell

Your reputation is the most important currency in Koii's ecosystem. It is a measure of how much the community trusts you, it is used to calibrate rewards and penalties in both the attention mining and compute marketplace.

:::

<Tooltip text="Wallet Reputation"/> is tracked and used to calibrate rewards and penalties in both <Tooltip text="Attention Mining"/> and the <Tooltip text="Compute Marketplace"/>. In attention mining, reputation prevents spam and rewards high-value contributions by tracking who appreciates them the most. In the compute marketplace, a node's reputation allows it to perform more work with less stake and earn more rewards because it is less likely to behave badly.

As the network grows, we expect to see rewards go disproportionately to participants with high reputations, and build a strong core group of committed community members who will hold these tokens for the long term, further reducing supply.&#x20;
