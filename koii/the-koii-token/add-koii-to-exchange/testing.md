Before deploying on Koii mainnet, it's important to test your workflow. This can be done on the testnet and/or devnet clusters. We recommend starting on devnet for initial development, then testing on testnet for a more realistic cluster configuration, then finally launching on the mainnet.

<!-- TODO: Update when mainnet launched -->
When mainnet is launched, both devnet and testnet will support a faucet, run `koii airdrop 1` to obtain some devnet or testnet KOII for development and testing.
