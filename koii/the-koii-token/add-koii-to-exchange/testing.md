<!-- TODO: DOES/WILL KOII HAVE BOTH TESTNET AND DEVNET? -->
Be sure to test your complete workflow on Solana devnet and testnet [clusters](/docs/core/clusters) before moving to production on mainnet-beta. Devnet is the most open and flexible, and ideal for initial development, while testnet offers more realistic cluster configuration. Both devnet and testnet support a faucet, run `koii airdrop 1` to obtain some devnet or testnet KOII for development and testing.
