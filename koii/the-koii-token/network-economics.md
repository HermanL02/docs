Koii is a decentralized protocol, meaning that anyone can create a fork to build their version for a specific purpose.

In our current implementation, the settlement layer provides payment processing and dispute resolution services to support the compute economy, while providing a historical ledger.

Since the settlement layer is decentralized, there is no central ownership body, and following the examples of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, a tokenized model was implemented to ensure bad actors can be appropriately penalized.

Transaction fees paid in KOII tokens control how data is added to the network, preventing a bad actor from flooding the system with spam.

Note: The token does not confer governance rights, nor does it provide any ownership of the system. Ownership of tokens does permit a community member to run either a <Tooltip text="K2 Validator"/> or a <Tooltip text="Task Node"/>, and provide services to the network.
