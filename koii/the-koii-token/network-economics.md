# Tokenomics

![banner](tokenomics/img/NETWORK%20ECONOMICS.svg)

Koii is a <Tooltip text="Decentralized Protocol"/>, meaning that anyone can create a fork in order to build their own version for a specific purpose.

In our current implementation, the <Tooltip text="Settlement Layer"/> provides <Tooltip text="Payments Processing"/> and <Tooltip text="Dispute Resolution"/> services to support the compute economy, while providing a <Tooltip text="Historical Ledger"/>.

Since the settlement layer is decentralized, there is no central ownership body, and following the examples of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, a <Tooltip text="Tokenized Model"/> was implemented to ensure bad actors can be appropriately penalized.

Transaction fees paid in KOII tokens control how data is added to the network, preventing a bad actor from flooding the system with spam.

Note: The token does not confer <Tooltip text="Governance Rights"/>, nor does it provide any ownership of the system. Ownership of tokens does permit a community member to run either a <Tooltip text="K2 Node"/> or a <Tooltip text="Task Node"/>, and provide services to the network.
