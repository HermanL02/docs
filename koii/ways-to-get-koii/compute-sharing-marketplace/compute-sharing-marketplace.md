# Compute Sharing Marketplace

![banner](../img/Compute%20Sharing%20Marketplace.svg)

Nodes that form the application layer are one of the most-needed commodities in Web3.

Via this global network of machines that can provide computing power, we can democratize and revolutionize the way we build and use the internet.

Once a content creator or app developer mines KOII, they have the option of staking their new tokens as collateral against either a <Tooltip text="Task Node"/> or a <Tooltip text="K2 Settlement Node"/>.

Task nodes provide web app and microservice hosting and support an open and extensible consensus process known as <Tooltip text="Gradual Consensus"/>, while settlement nodes provide fast payments using a storage-based Solana fork.

Task nodes perform automated microservices for the network and receive KOII tokens for their work.

As the task nodes work through their tasks, they post various signed payloads to storage layers or their personal API, and each node checks the work of the others before writing votes into the K2 layer and trigger the distribution of the bounty.

If you want to earn KOII while you sleep, you can checkout our **Run a Task Node** section.

## **How does it work?**

When you run a task node on a personal device or hosted server, you can select from a list of known tasks that suit your device type, and then begin staking your KOII tokens in order to fulfill the task responsibilities.

Each task contains an executable, an <Tooltip text="audit function"/>, and a <Tooltip text="rewards model"/>, which can be audited by any user in advance of participation.

Once staked, your node must remain online to fulfill task executions according to the rules of the **audit function** and will operate in the background on your devices to provide microservices to developers.

If you want to upgrade your existing systems and don't have the resources, contact us here for a [grant](https://www.koii.network/founders) to cover hardware and hosting.

## **Get Involved**

While the network is still in its early stages, our community has tens of thousands of node runners and applicants, providing a global network of personal computers.
