# Grants Program

![banner](img/Grants%20Program.svg)

The Koii foundation gives grants to developers and anyone who wants to build new and more rewarding online experiences.&#x20;

Grants are given for helping build core technology, proofs of concept for novel applications of the technology, or other initiatives that make the network grow faster or stronger.

**Note:** Koii grants can be in our native compute credits, KOII or USD. They can only be redeemed to use the network, not sold to fund operations.&#x20;
