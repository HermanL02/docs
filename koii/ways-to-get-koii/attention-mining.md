# Attention Mining

**Collect Proofs of Real Traffic on your content to mine new KOII tokens each
day!**

KOII tokens can be earned by tracking <Tooltip text="Proofs of Real Traffic"/> (PoRT) on your **website** or **content.**

PoRT is generated by a user's wallet when they visit your website or content. The Finnie wallet composes these in the background as users browse, then broadcasts the PoRTs to Koii nodes at regular intervals.
