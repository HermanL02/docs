**Collect Proofs of Real Traffic on your content to mine new KOII tokens each
day!**

KOII tokens can be earned by tracking Proofs of Real Traffic (PoRT) on your **website** or **content.**

Proof of Real Traffic (PoRT) is generated by a user's wallet when they visit your website / content. The Finnie wallet composes these in the background as users browse, then broadcasts the PoRTs to Koii nodes at regular intervals.&#x20;
